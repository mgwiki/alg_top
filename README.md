# Welcome to our algebraic topology mgwiki!

This is a wiki for formal mathematics written in the Megalodon system ([1],[2]).

Megalodon is an interactive theorem prover/proof checker based on higher-order Tarski-Grothendieck set theory. It is the successor system to Egal ([3]).

The wiki allows you to edit Megalodon files online and check them automatically without the need of local installation.

The workflow is to clone/fork this repo, edit/add some files, and then commit/push, which will trigger the checking and html-ization. If there are errors, they will be shown in the output of the github action (at an address like this: https://github.com/mgwiki/mgw_test/actions/ )
and the html-ization will not be triggered. 

When your edits are done, you can issue a pull request (PR) to the main mgwiki repo.

## Conjectures, Bounties 

The wiki can be used to create and solve open conjectures and put bounties on them. When a .mg (Megalodon) file 
is added to this wiki, it is automatically checked and bounties are issued or redeemed.
